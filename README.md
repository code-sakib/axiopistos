# Axiopistos 🏆

**Luxury Collectibles Authentication Platform powered by zkTLS**

Axiopistos is an iOS application that revolutionizes how luxury collectibles are verified and showcased. Using zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) technology, we create verifiable proofs of product authenticity without exposing sensitive purchase data.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **zkTLS Authentication** - Cryptographic proof of purchase authenticity
- 🏺 **Luxury Collectibles** - Browse verified premium items and collections
- ✅ **Verified Ownership** - See authenticated owners from trusted sources
- 📱 **Native iOS Experience** - Built with React Native and Expo
- 🔥 **Real-time Database** - Firebase integration for seamless data management
- 🛡️ **Privacy First** - Zero-knowledge proofs protect sensitive information

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- Expo CLI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/axiopistos.git
   cd axiopistos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the iOS app**
   ```bash
   npm run expo:ios
   ```

That's it! The app will launch in your iOS simulator or connected device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo SDK 54
- **Mobile SDK**: Xion's Dave Mobile SDK
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore & Authentication
- **Authentication**: zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security)
- **Platform**: iOS (Android coming soon)

## 📱 How It Works

1. **Browse Collections** - Explore luxury collectibles from verified sources
2. **zkTLS Verification** - Products are authenticated through cryptographic proofs
3. **Trusted Network** - See verified owners without exposing private purchase data
4. **Secure Ecosystem** - Trade and collect with complete authenticity confidence

### zkTLS Implementation

Axiopistos integrates with verified luxury retailers (auction houses, authorized dealers) to:
- Generate cryptographic proofs of authentic purchases
- Verify product legitimacy across multiple trusted sources
- Protect sensitive buyer information while ensuring transparency
- Create immutable authenticity certificates

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Luxury Collectors** - Verify authenticity before purchasing high-value items
- **Resellers** - Provide cryptographic proof of authenticity to buyers
- **Auction Houses** - Showcase verified provenance of collectibles
- **Insurance** - Use verification proofs for accurate item valuation

## 🔮 Roadmap
